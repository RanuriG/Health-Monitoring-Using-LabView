# Heart-Attack-Detection-and-Health-Monitoring-System-using-LABVIEW

The project utilizes affordable sensors, IoT technology, and open-source software to detect and alert potential heart attacks in real-time. The system will use a Node-RED flow to analyze the sensor data and a Node-RED function node to identify potential heart attacks and send emergency messages to close relatives. The data collected will be continuously analyzed using MATLAB to detect patterns of a personâ€™s health. The project aims to develop a comprehensive and affordable approach to health monitoring and help prevent complications associated with heart attacks.
